# Magnetic Coils
C++ program calculates the magnetic field produced by current loops that are axially aligned. 

Developed as part of my undergraduate physics [thesis](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.12297.85606) to model a pair of thick, wide coils used in a negative ion matter interferometer. 

## Requirements
Uses the Boost library to solve elliptic integrals.
